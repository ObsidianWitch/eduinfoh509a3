\section{Authors \& coauthors}

This exercise's goal was to retrieve for each author the number of coauthors
and the number of joint publications with each of them.\\

First of all, all the authors were retrieved from the publications. The same
author can appear on multiple publications, so we had to use the
\hl{fn:distinct-values()} function in order to avoid duplicates.\\

Then, for each author, we apply our user-defined function \hl{ufn:coauthors()}
in order to retrieve for this particular author the number of coauthors and
the number of joint publications with each of them.\\

In order to do so, the coauthors were defined as all the authors which
participated in the same publications as the author currently being handled
(see listing below).\\

\begin{lstlisting}
declare function ufn:coauthors($author, $author_publications) {
    let $coauthors := fn:distinct-values($author_publications/author[. != $author])
    let $nb_coauthors := fn:count($coauthors)
    ...
\end{lstlisting}
\

Finally, for each coauthor, we retrieved the number of publications in which
both the author and the coauthor participated.\\

\begin{lstlisting}
for $coauth in $coauthors
    let $common_publications := $author_publications[author = $coauth]
    let $nb_common_publications := fn:count($common_publications)
\end{lstlisting}
