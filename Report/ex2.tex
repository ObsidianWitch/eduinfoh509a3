\section{Proceedings}

\noindent For each proceeding, we had to display it and its associated
inproceedings titles.\\

There were no difficulties here, first of all, all
proceedings were retrieved by filtering the publications by their node name
(\hl{fn:name()}). And then, for each of these proceedings, their title was
retrieved, as well as their associated inproceedings by filtering on the
crossref attribute using the proceeding's key value.\\

Once the proceeding's title and associated inproceedings are retrieved, they can
be returned. As, these are different elements (\hl{<proc\_title></proc\_title>}
and \hl{<title></title>}), the return tag must be followed by parenthesis
encapsulating the elements we want to return (see listing below).\\

\begin{lstlisting}
for $proc in $proceedings
    let $proc_title := <proc_title>{$proc/title/text()}</proc_title>
    let $inproc_titles := ufn:inproceedings($proc/@key, $dblp)

    return (
        $proc_title,
        $inproc_titles
    )
\end{lstlisting}
