\section{Introduction}

The goal of this assignment was to query an excerpt of the dblp bibliography
in order to retrieve information such as authors and their coauthors, and
create new XML trees.\\

\begin{framehint}
    All the results from the different scripts were retrieved and stored in the
    \emph{Output} directory.
\end{framehint}

\begin{framehint}
    In order to run our scripts, the \emph{xqilla} \cite{cite:xqilla} engine was
    used, as well as the \emph{xpathtester} \cite{cite:xpathtester} website for
    quick and simple tests.
\end{framehint}
